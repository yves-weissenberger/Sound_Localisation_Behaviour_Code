Possible training changes:
- Stop rewarding the 2nd speaker spout lick
- 2nd lick at centre replays sound
- Maybe 1/10 centre rewards?
- Time out: need to collect spout reward within 5 seconds
- broadband/ narrowband noise/ clicks
- sound stops playing when lick the edge
- repetitive stimulus e.g. 2/second like K&K


Things that could have gone wrong:
- associate sound with drinking from the centre spout
- learnt to go to opposite speaker spout (not sure why)
- may not have been rewarded immidiately on the first lick
- may have learnt a habit (either C, L, C, R or C, L, R, C)
- low motivation


K&K training:
1) drink from both speaker spouts
2) shaped to climb onto centre pedestal and touch nose to centre spout
3) Appropriate responses were reinforced by presenting a sound from one of two speakers located at +30° or -30° positions in the maze, followed by water reward after contact with the correct spout. Following a correct response, the position of the sound source was randomly determined for the next trial. In case of an incorrect response, however, the sound source remained in the same position for subsequent trials until a correction response was made. 
4)Animals were first tested with repeated stimuli presented at a rate of 2/s. Under this condition the stimulus was available from the time a trial was initiated at the center spout until a response (correct or incorrect) had been completed. All animals rapidly learned to respond to repeated clicks, with performance levels above 90% correct in a single daily session.
